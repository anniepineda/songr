# Building Full-Stack Web Apps
- App runs on Spring
- App has a hello world route at /hello, and ensure that you can visit that route in your browser and see a rendered
 template come back.
- App has a route that turns words into UPPER CASE. For instance, you are able to visit /capitalize/hello and get
 back an HTML page containing the response HELLO, or visit /capitalize/this is Kinda Capitalized and get an HTML page
  containing the response THIS IS KINDA CAPITALIZED.
- App has a basic splash page for the Songr app, available at the root route, and style it appropriately with CSS.
